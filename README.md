# AWS App Deployment with Terraform

This project contains a simple web application deployed on AWS using Terraform. The infrastructure includes:

- A **frontend** served via Apache HTTP server
- A **backend** API written in Python and Flask
- Deployment is fully automated with Terraform and EC2 User Data scripts
